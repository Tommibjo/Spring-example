## Having 1st touch to Spring framework
Ex-employer had position open which required Spring framework knowledge.. "What's spring framework?" were the thoughts in my head.
Also my first  touch to Maven (Great stuff).

 * Created with Eclipse Java EE IDE Oxygen.3a
 * Apache Maven (4.0.0)  
 * Spring framework
 
 ## Usage
 
 There is no usage. Though this project was usefull for me:
 I am learning ABC:s of Spring framework (i.e. About beanfactory, XML conf, injections)
