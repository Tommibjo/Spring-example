##Having 1st touch to Spring framework
Ex-employer had position open which required Spring framework knowledge.. "What's spring framework?" were the thoughts in my head.
Also my first  touch to Maven (Great stuff).

 * Created with Eclipse Java EE IDE Oxygen.3a
 * Apache Maven (4.0.0)  
 * Spring framework
 
 ##Usage
 
 There is no usage. Though this project was usefull for me:
 I am learning ABC:s of Spring framework.
 
 Displaying the usage of:
 * ApplicationContext (Beanfactory container)
  -> TextInterface.java
 * How to set properties of bean in Spring Bean Configuration XML file via <property>
  -> Customer.java
 * How to set bean constructor arguments in Spring Bean Configuration XML file via <constructor-arg>		
  -> PurchaseOrder.java
 * How to do simple dependency injection (injecting Terms dependency to Customer class)					
  -> dependent: Customer.java - dependency: terms.java
